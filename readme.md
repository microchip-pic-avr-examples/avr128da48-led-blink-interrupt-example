# AVR128DA48 LED Blink with Interrupt Example

This repository provides an Atmel Studio solution with a bare metal code example for an LED blink driven by a timer overflow interrupt.

This example demonstrates a simple toggling of a LED connected to the PC6 (on-board user LED) with a period of 1 second implemented through the use of an interrupt generated by the overflow of TCA0.

## Configurations

- PC6 - configured as digital output (the on-board user LED)
- TCA0:
	* Normal mode
	* Input clock Main Clock (4MHz) /256
	* Overflow interrupt enabled
	* Period 0x2000
- CPUINT:
	* Global interrupt enabled
